Equilibrium equations
=============

Functions to calculate the equilibrium concentration and speciation of volatiles in melt Â± vapor and the proportions of melt and vapor given P, T, and the bulk composition of the system. These are iterative calculations, which are solved using Jacobian matrix/Newton-Raphson approach (solvers and initial guesses are also in this file).
