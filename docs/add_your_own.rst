Add your own

The idea is VolFe is flexible and adaptable, such that new parameterisations for :doc:`model dependent variables <current_mdv>` can be added as they become available. 
New calculation types (and even new species!) can also be added, but it is more involved.

In these examples we show you how to add new parameterisations for model dependent variables: 

- :doc:`Example 6a <Examples/6a. solubility_constant>`: Solubility constants (example for H2S). [in progress]

- :doc:`Example 6b <Examples/6b. new_fO2>`: Fe3+/FeT to fO2 dependence. [in progress]
