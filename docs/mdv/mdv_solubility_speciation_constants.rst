Solubility and speciation constants
===================================================================================

Below are the different models for the solubility and speciation constants currently in VolFe, which can also be viewed in the :doc:`solubility and speciation constants notebook <SolSpecConst>`.
This is how VolFe incorporates the effect of melt composition on the solubility and speciation of volatile species in the melt.

### IN PROGRESS ###

Currently available parameterisations of solubility and speciation constants for and range of conditions of experiments used for calibration (unfortunately, not necessarily the range they are appropriate for).

Carbon dioxide and carbonate solubility
---------------------------------------

**MORB_Dixon95:** depends on *P*, experiments range 1170–1600 'C and 201–15000 bar on MORB compoisition. Bullet (5) of summary from Dixon et al. (1995), which includes values from Pan et al. (1991).

**Basalt_Dixon97:** depends on *P* and *Xsil*, experiments range 1170–1600 'C and 1000–15000 bar on basalts. Eq. (7) from Dixon (1997) as shown in Eq. (1, 5) from Witham et al. (2012), which includes values from Pan et al. (1991).

**NorthArchBasalt_Dixon97:** depends on *P* and SiO2, experiments range 1170–1600 'C and 1000–15000 bar on basalts (North Arch). Eq. (8) from Dixon (1997), which includes values from Pan et al. (1991)

-------------------------

**Basalt_Hughes24:** depends on *P*, experiments range 1340–1617 'C and 350–32000 bar on basalts. Table S4 from Hughes et al. (2024) based on data from Armstrong et al. (2015), Stanley et al., (2014), and Wetzel et al., (2013).

Methane solubility
-------------------------

**Basalt_Ardia13:** depends on *P*, experiments ranges 1400–1450 'C and 7000–30000 bar on Fe-free basalt. Eq. (7a) from Ardia et al. (2013).
