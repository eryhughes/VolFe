Solubility and speciation constants
===================================================================================

Below are the different models for the solubility and speciation constants currently in VolFe, which can also be viewed in the :doc:`solubility and speciation constants notebook <SolSpecConst>`.
This is how VolFe incorporates the effect of melt composition on the solubility and speciation of volatile species in the melt.

### IN PROGRESS ###

Currently available parameterisations of solubility and speciation constants for and range of conditions of experiments used for calibration (unfortunately, not necessarily the range they are appropriate for).
