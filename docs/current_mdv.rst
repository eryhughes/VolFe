    Model dependent variables
    ===

    Various parameters in VolFe can be calculated using different models - these include things like solubility constants, speciation constants, equilibrium constants, fugacity coefficients, etc. 
    For solubility and speciation constants, oxygen fugacity to Fe3+/FeT relationships, and sulfur saturation conditions, this is how VolFe includes the effect of melt compositions on calculations.
    
    There are some models already available in VolFe, which are detailed below. Others can be added as they become available - let us know if you have a new model to be added!
